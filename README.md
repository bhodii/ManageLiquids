# Manage Liquids

A mod for [Caves of Qud](https://www.cavesofqud.com/)

This mod manages inventory liquids. When configured in the (o)ptions menu and then activated through player's (l)ook menu, it sorts your inventory liquids.

Features include:

* Consolidates liquids in inventory containers, taking into account size and weight
* Reserves a configurable amount of liquid to be kept separate (for ease of dropping/selling the consolidated excess)
* Configurable liquid types - Water, Honey, Cider, Oil, Acid, Blood, and Other
* Refills liquid-based cells
* Handles dangerous liquids (acid in canteen, lava in phial, etc.)
* Works with any mods that add additional containers
* Can be safely removed from and added to existing saves
